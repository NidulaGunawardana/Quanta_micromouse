### Suggested Workflow:
1. **Planning Phase**:
   - **Project Manager**: Organizes a kickoff meeting, defines the project scope, and sets milestones.
   - **All Members**: Discuss the overall design, algorithms, control strategies, and simulation setup.

2. **Development Phase**:
   - **Algorithm Developer**: Starts developing initial versions of maze-solving algorithms.
   - **Controller Developer**: Begins designing the control system, possibly starting with basic PID controllers.
   - **Simulation Developer**: Sets up the initial MATLAB simulation environment and creates basic models for the micromouse and maze.

3. **Integration Phase**:
   - **Algorithm and Controller Developers**: Collaborate to integrate algorithms with the control system in the simulation.
   - **Simulation Developer**: Incorporates the integrated algorithms and control system into the simulation and starts running tests.
   - **Hardware Specialist**: Works on assembling the micromouse and testing basic hardware functionalities.

4. **Testing and Iteration Phase**:
   - **All Members**: Regularly test the simulation and the actual micromouse, gather data, and refine algorithms and controllers.
   - **Hardware Specialist**: Continuously provides feedback from hardware tests to the software team for improvements.

5. **Final Phase**:
   - **Project Manager**: Ensures all components are integrated and functioning as intended.
   - **All Members**: Conduct final tests, fine-tune the system, and prepare for demonstrations or competitions.

Effective communication and collaboration are key to the success of the project. Regular meetings, clear documentation, and a shared repository (e.g., Git) for code and models can help streamline the workflow and ensure everyone is on the same page.
